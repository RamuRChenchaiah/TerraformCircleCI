This module creates an AWS S3 bucket that can be used to host a static website. That is, the website can contain static HTML, CSS, JS, and images.

== Features
* Offload storage and serving of static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images) to an S3 bucket configured as a website.
* Specify custom routing rules for the website.
* Optionally configure a custom domain name for the website.
* Optionally deploy a CDN in front of S3 using the link:/modules/s3-cloudfront[s3-cloudfront module].


== Learn
The reason to serve static content from S3 rather than from your own app server is that it can significantly reduce the load on your server, allowing it to solely focus on serving dynamic data. This will save you money and make your website run faster. For even bigger improvements in performance, consider deploying a CloudFront Content Distribution Network (CDN) in front of the S3 bucket using the s3-cloudfront module.
